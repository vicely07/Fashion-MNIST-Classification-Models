# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-Models
Assignment:
In this assignment, you will build a convolutional neural network that learns to predict one of the 10 classes of the Fashion-MNIST dataset which comprises grayscale images of 10 different classes of clothes.
You will use TensorFlow for this assignment. Make sure that you have a working python virtual environment and that you have installed any packages required. 
The first objective is to go to these link, download the dataset and run the code. Follow all the steps of this tutorial, put some images on your report and make sure that you receive the same test-accuracy with the one reported. 
The second objective is to replace the Fully-Connected layers with Convolutional layers so as to learn better feature representations. The last layers that maps the features to the 10 classes should remain the same. Build such a model (keep it simple with 2-3 Conv layers) and evaluate your performance,
The third objective is to write a paragraph in your report about what other design choices can you make to learn better features? Please run small experiments to validate your hypothesis.
